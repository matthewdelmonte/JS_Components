// AboutMe text from the original website

// First paragraph
My mother learned a very unique skill later in her life of jewelry making and wanted to pass it on to me.  At first, it honestly didn’t take off but a couple of years after she had passed, I really started creating and designing jewelry.  It has now become a passion of mine and I love being able to have such a creative outlet!

// Second paragraph
My first pieces were the Story Lockets but that wasn’t designing nor creating anything.  I then got inspired to do earrings and really liked that.  While shopping one day I got the idea of a Vintage bracelet wrap design adding vintage and antique buttons.  They were a HIT!  I like to upcycle pieces so no wrap is exactly alike!
